## NonStandard libraries
This public-domain open-sourced project is an experimental package distribution system for Unity. run `node compile.js all` to re-create `package.json` files in nearby library folders, and create `gitimport.bat` batch file that will import libraries from git (which will be ignored by the updated `.gitignore` file).

Created by Michael Vaganov.
